    <h2 id="glossary-of-zype-terms">Glossary of Zype Terms</h2>

<p>The Zype developer portal uses some predefined language to reference certain aspects of the platform. We thought it might be helpful to have a glossary section so that you can be sure
we’re on the same page. Below is a list of terms that we use and their definitions.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="platforms">Platforms</h3>
<hr />

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Your Site</td>
      <td>When we reference “Your site”, we’re talking about the site where you display your video content.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="margin-right: 82px;">Zype.com</span></td>
      <td>The public facing website at: http://www.zype.com/</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Zype Developer Portal</td>
      <td>The public facing website geared towards developers who are using the Zype Platform.</td>

</table>

    <tr>
      <td><span style="margin-right: 92px;">Admins</span></td>

<hr />

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>AES-128</td>
      <td>The Advanced Encryption Standard is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution-permutation network, combination of both substitution and permutation, and is fast in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, the Rijndael specification per se is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, both with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="margin-right: 98px;">Bitrate</span></td>
      <td>In digital multimedia, bitrate represents the amount of information, or detail, that is stored per unit of time of a recording. The bitrate depends on several factors: The original material may be sampled at different frequencies. The samples may use different numbers of bits. The data may be encoded by different schemes. The information may be digitally compressed by different algorithms or to different degrees.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Codec</td>
      <td>A codec encodes a data stream or signal for transmission, storage or encryption, or decodes it for playback or editing. Codecs are used in videoconferencing, streaming media and video editing applications. A video camera’s analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts its analog signals into digital signals, which are then passed through a video compressor for digital transmission or storage. A receiving device then runs the signal through a video decompressor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>DPT</td>
      <td>Zype’s Dynamic Player Technology allows Admins to create player rules which govern the video source that is used to serve content to a consumer based on their region and device.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>HLS</td>
      <td>HTTP Live Streaming is an HTTP-based media streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. as part of their QuickTime, Safari, OS X, and iOS software. It works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small HTTP-based file downloads, each download loading one short chunk of an overall potentially unbounded transport stream. As the stream is played, the client may select from a number of different alternate streams containing the same material encoded at a variety of data rates, allowing the streaming session to adapt to the available data rate. At the start of the streaming session, it downloads an extended M3U playlist containing the metadata for the various sub-streams which are available.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>M3U8</td>
      <td>The Unicode version of “m3u” is “m3u8”, which uses UTF-8 Unicode characters. “m3u” and “m3u8” files are the basis for the HTTP Live Streaming format used by Apple to stream video to iOS devices.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resolution</td>
      <td>The display resolution of a digital television, computer monitor or display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors on different devices.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3 id="general-terms">General Terms</h3>
<hr />

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="margin-right: 118px;">GIF</span></td>
      <td>The Graphics Interchange Format is a bitmap image format that was introduced by CompuServe in 1987 and has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>HTTP</td>
      <td>HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. A web browser, for example, may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a web site may be the server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JPEG</td>
      <td>In computing, JPEG (seen most often with the .jpg or .jpeg filename extension) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JSON</td>
      <td>JavaScript Object Notation, is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON is a language-independent data format. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in a large variety of programming languages.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PNG</td>
      <td>Portable Network Graphics is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the most used lossless image compression format on the Internet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>REST</td>
      <td>Web service APIs that adhere to the REST architectural constraints are called RESTful. HTTP based RESTful APIs are defined with these aspects: base URI, such as http://example.com/resources/ , an Internet media type for the data. This is often JSON but can be any other valid Internet media type (e.g. XML, Atom, microformats, images, etc.), standard HTTP methods (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE), hypertext links to reference state, hypertext links to reference related resources.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>XML</td>
      <td>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format which is both human-readable and machine-readable. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.</td>

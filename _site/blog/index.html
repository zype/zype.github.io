Each video that you add to the platform has a snippet of code located under the Embed Code tab. You can navigate to the tab by finding a video that you want to embed and clicking on the edit button. The tab appears along the top of the menu.</p>

metadata that you can create and associate with your videos. In the tutorial below,
we will show how to associate an the actor John Boyega to the newest Star Wars trailer.
To do this, we will create a zobject type called actors and then create a zobject actor for John Boyega.
Lastly, we will associate John Boyega with the Star Wars trailer.</p>

        <p>Adding image assets to your Roku Channel allow your to make the channel your own!
Using the Zype Platform and Zype API, you will be able to change the majority of
images on the fly without having to republish your app. However, there are a few images
that need to be bundled during installation because they make up your
application icon set. These images live on the Roku Channel store.
This tutorial will describe the images that need to be bundled, the images that can
be updated via the Zype Platform, and the specs for both.</p>

        <p>We aim to make the development process of a Roku Channel as easy as possible using
our <a href="https://github.com/zype/zype-roku">Zype Roku SDK</a>. To do this, our sample Roku Channel
focuses on three major components of the Zype Platform: playlists, categories, and zobjects.
Since the playlists, categories, and zobjects are being pulled into your Roku channel
using the Zype API, they are all editable using the Zype Platform and do not require
republishing to the Roku Channel Store to make a change.</p>

In this tutorial, we will walk through how to publish a Private Roku Channel that you can
share immediately with anyone that owns a Roku. If you are interested in publishing a Public Roku Channel, the steps are very similar, just you have to wait for Roku to approve your channel before it can be accessed in the Roku Channel Store. It is recommended that you first publish a private channel, test the channel out to beta users, and then publish the channel publicly.</p>

        <p>In a <a href="http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/28/develop-roku-app-with-zype-sdk/">previous tutorial</a>,
we described how to develop a Roku app using the Zype SDK and testing it locally.
In this tutorial, we will walk through how to publish a Private Roku Channel that you can
share immediately. If you are interested in publishing a Public Roku Channel, the steps are very similar, just you have to wait for Roku to approve your channel before it can be accessed
in the Roku Channel Store. It is recommended that you first publish a private channel, test the
channel out to beta users, and then publish the channel publicly.</p>

Before, you had to manually go to YouTube and find your Channel ID. This was a cumbersome
process. Now you can search for a YouTube Channel from the Zype Platform and we will get the Channel ID for you.</p>

In this post, we&#8217;ll be covering how to create a playlist of related videos that are recommended to a viewer
based on what the video they&#8217;re watching. Here&#8217;s an example of the finished product:</p>

        <p>In a previous post, we covered how to use Zype’s Dynamic Player Technology (DPT).
In this post, we’ll be covering how to use the DPT logs to see what requests are being made for your video content.
For example, let’s say you’ve uploaded a batch of new videos and after the first 30 days, you’d like to get an idea
of who’s viewing your content and what times of the day are most popular for viewing.</p>

        <p>Zype’s DPT allows you to create player rules based on geography and device.
For example, you could declare that end users will receive the Hulu Player if he
or she is accessing your video via desktop in the United States or the Zype Player
if he or she is accessing your video via desktop in Australia.</p>

        <p>To organize your playlists using the Zype Platform, you can assign categories to
your playlists and filter your playlists based on a category and its value.
In this tutorial, I will walk through how to query for all the playlists that have
a category named ‘zone’ and a value of ‘home.’ At Zype, we use this
strategy to get all the playlists that we want to be displayed on the home page or zone.</p>

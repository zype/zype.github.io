We have simplified the process of publishing a Roku Channel from the Zype Platform.
The process now has three parts. First, you need to set up your channel.
Then, Zype will build your Channel for you or you can
[self-publish your Channel]({{site.url}}posts/2015/02/13/self-publish-roku/).

**Step 1: Set Up Your Video Library and Channel**

First, you will need to upload and transcode videos onto the Zype Platform.
Currently, Roku Channels only support videos with a Zype video source.

Second, you will need to set up your Roku Channel. Navigate to the Video Apps page

Click on Roku to set up a new Roku Channel for publishing

Set up your Roku Channel by supplying a title, subtitle, a channel image, and
select a channel template. Zype will create multiple images from your one supplied
channel image including your channel logo, poster art, and loading screen.
It is suggested to have a 640 px by 480 px PNG image because the image will be used
in many different sizes.

**Step 2: Zype Builds Your Roku Channel**

Once you set up your Channel, Zype will bundle the necessary images and prepare the
code for your Roku Channel. All you have to do is wait a couple of minutes!
The page will automatically refresh once your Channel is ready.

**Step 3: Publish Channel**

You can choose to either self-publish or have Zype publish your Roku Channel for you.
If you choose to self publish [click here]({{site.url}}posts/2015/02/13/self-publish-roku/)
to read our guide to self publish your Roku Channel.
If you choose to have Zype publish your channel, you will be sent to a checkout
page to redeem your publishing package or pay for a publishing package.
Once you checkout, a member of the Zype team will package, QA, and submit your
Roku Channel to the Roku Channel Store.

Typically, once your Roku Channel is submitted to the Roku Channel Store, it takes
3-4 weeks to get to the front of the QA queue and then another 1-2 weeks for approval.
You should expect to wait atleast 4-6 weeks for your Roku Channel to be available
on the Roku Channel Store.

**Step 4: Edit Channel Settings**

The majority of settings for your Roku Channel are configured at run-time.
Thus, you can edit Channel settings such as your featured playlist, your logos and
themes without having to re-publish. [Click here]({{site.url}}posts/2015/02/13/roku-advanced-settings/)

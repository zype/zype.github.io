As you make your way through the [Zype Platform](http://admin.zype.com), you might have some
questions about the differences between a playlist and a category. At the end of the day, both
are used to return a set of videos, but they aren't exactly the same thing. This blog post
will look at categories and playlists and help you better understand how and when to use them.

### What are playlists and how do I use them?
A playlist on the Zype Platform is a collection of videos that you assemble under a title.
Common playlists might include: Trending Videos, Most Popular, Editor's Choice, etc. Playlists
are great for when you want to create and curate, by hand, a set of videos that might not fall
under a specific category.

### What are categories and how do I use them?
A category on the Zype Platform is a label that you can create and assign to any number of
videos. Common categories for video content might include: Genre, Tag, Type, Season, Series,
 etc. Categories are more generic than playlists and can be mass assigned to videos in your
[Video Library.](http://admin.zype.com/videos)

### I'm using the Zype Platform to create a Roku app, what's the difference for me?
Roku apps will treat categories and playlists the same, as they are both just a collection of
videos. For an in-depth guide on how to create your Roku App, make sure you check out [this blog post](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/12/03/categories-playlists-zobjects-roku/)

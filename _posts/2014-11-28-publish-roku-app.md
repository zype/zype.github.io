In [part two](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/28/develop-roku-app-with-zype-sdk/) of publishing a Roku Channel, we described how to develop a Roku app using the Zype SDK and running it locally.
In this tutorial, we will walk through how to publish a Private Roku Channel that you can
share immediately with anyone that owns a Roku. If you are interested in publishing a Public Roku Channel, the steps are very similar, just you have to wait for Roku to approve your channel before it can be accessed in the Roku Channel Store. It is recommended that you first publish a private channel, test the channel out to beta users, and then publish the channel publicly.

Before starting this tutorial, we will assume that you have already tested a Roku App
locally and are a registered Roku developer.

**Step 1**

Log into your Roku developer account and click Manage My Channels

**Step 2**

Click add Private Channel. If you want to publish a Public Channel, click add Public Channel.
The steps are the same for private and public channels, except that you will need to
give contact information in case Roku has questions when they are reviewing your app.

**Step 3**

Fill out Channel Properties for your channel.

**Step 4**

Fill our Channel Descriptions for your channel. You will need to have an HD Poster
that is a 290 x 218 JPEG file and an SD Poster that is a 214 x 144 JPEG file.

**Step 5**

You can optionally upload screenshots of your Roku Channel. Read the [Roku documentation](http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Channel+Packaging+And+Publishing#ChannelPackagingAndPublishing-38GeneratingScreenshotsSincev31onRoku1andv43onRoku2) on how to generate a screenshot.

**Step 6**

Last, you will need to upload your application package. Follow the instructions from the [Roku documentation](http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Channel+Packaging+And+Publishing#ChannelPackagingAndPublishing-30PackagingYourApplication) on how to generate a key and then package your channel.

Once you have downloaded your Roku Channel package, upload the application package and click the "Publish" arrow. You will get an access code url that can be used to download the private
Roku channel on your individual Roku account.

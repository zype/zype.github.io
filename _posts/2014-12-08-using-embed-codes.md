We're happy to announce that the [Zype Platform](http://admin.zype.com) now grants you the power to "grab and go" with embed codes! Each video that you add to the platform has a snippet of code located under the Embed Code tab. You can navigate to the tab by finding a video that you want to embed and clicking on the edit button. The tab appears along the top of the menu.

![Go to Embed Code]({{site.url}}/assets/Embedding a Player on Your Site/embed_tab.png)

The embed codes are designed to be dropped into a webpage, wherever you need them. The div id must remain the same, but other than that, you're free to do as you please. As the page states, we recommend that you include the javascript portion of the embed code before the closing body tag on the page.

We hope you use this feature to get up and running with Zype videos on your site in the blink of an eye!

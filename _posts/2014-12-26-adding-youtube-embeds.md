We're happy to announce that the [Zype Platform](http://admin.zype.com) now grants you the power to import videos from YouTube simply by copying an pasting a YouTube link into the platform.

Check out the [Video Imports Screen](http://admin.zype.com/video_imports) and click on the "Add a YouTube Video Import" button to get started.

The next step is to copy a URL from YouTube that shows the video you want to add.

Paste the URL into the field on this page and click "Add Video Import".

If everything went according to plan, you should see the video imports screen again, with a new import from the link you provided.

Before we start, lets look at what the end result of what your iPhone App will look like!

To configure your iPhone App using the Zype Platform, navigate to the Video Apps page and click
on the iPhone logo.

Next, fill in the App Details. This includes the title, the version number, and the store icon.
The store icon will be the icon that users click to on your iPhone screen to enter your app.

Then, fill out the Channel Information. The banner image is what appears at the top of your home
screen. The larger banner is for higher quality displays. Check out the mock up of an iPhone App
below to see where the banner gets displayed in the home screen.

Next, add tiles. Tiles are what a user can click on in the app’s home screen to go to the appropriate page. An iPhone app can have up to 9 tiles.
Tiles can include links to Twitter, Facebook, Google+, your blog, your personal website,
favorites, videos, and messages. You can drag the tiles in the editor to change their order on
the iPhone Screen. Check out the mock up tosee where the tiles get displayed.

If you would like to add a message to your users at this time, you can click on the Message tab
and add a message.

Once you are finished, click save changes. You will be redirected to the iPhone App details
screen where you will see a mock up of your channel home screen. You can either
use Zype's [API documentation]({{site.url/api_docs/apps}}) to self-publish or have Zype publish
for you!

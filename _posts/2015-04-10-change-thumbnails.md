When you upload a video to the Zype Platform, Zype will create thumbnails for your video.
To change your the thumbnail for your video, follow the steps below. Note, this is only
to change your thumbnail from a video uploaded directly to the Zype Platform. It does not apply to
thumbnails from an external data source like YouTube or Vimeo.

**Step 1:**

From your video library, click on the video that you want to change the thumbnail
for and click on the "Thumbnails" tab.

**Step 2:**

![thumbnail 2]({{site.url}}/assets/thumbnails/thumbnails_2.png)

Select the thumbnail that you want. The thumbnail will automatically be updated!

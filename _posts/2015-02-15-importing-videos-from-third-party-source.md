We’ve made it easier to import your videos from third party sources like YouTube, Vimeo, or Hulu
to your video library! Now, the default option is to automatically add all video imports to your
video library as new videos.


**Step 1: Add your video source and make sure that add videos is turned on**

**Step 2: Navigate to your Video Library, you should see new videos from your video source that
are active! Note, videos will be added to your video library as they become available**

**Advanced Importing**

If you do not want to automatically import all of the videos from a video source to your video
library or if you want to merge your video imports to videos preexisting in your library, you can
turn add video ‘off’ when you create a video source and use the “Advanced Video Importing”
option.

Then, navigate to the video imports screen and click on the add button for the videos that you
want to add to your video library or the merge button if you want to merge your video imports to
preexisting videos in your video library.

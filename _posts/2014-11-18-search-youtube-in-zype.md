We simplified the process of searching for and importing a YouTube Channel into the Zype Platform.
Before, you had to manually go to YouTube and find your Channel ID. This was a cumbersome
process. Now you can search for a YouTube Channel from the Zype Platform and we will get the Channel ID for you.

**Step 1:**

Go to Video Sources and click on the YouTube icon.

**Step 2:**

Enter a name for your YouTube Video Source (something to help you remember it!) and click the
Search YouTube Channels button

**Step 3:**

Enter the channel name that you are searching for and click Search. You will be
given a list of YouTube Channels that match your search criteria. Click the Select Channel
button for the YouTube Channel that you want to add.

**Step 4:**

This will prepopulate the Channel ID for you. All you need to do is click Save Changes
and the Zype Platform will start to import all of the videos from the channel that you selected!

**Step 5:**

Your imported videos are in your import videos page. You can add videos to your catalogue
from there.

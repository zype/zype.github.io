With the Zype Platform, you can import all of the videos within a YouTube Channel.
This tutorial will go over the three steps to importing all the videos within a Youtube
Channel to your Zype video library.

**Step 1**

On the Video Source page in the Zype Platform, click on new YouTube Video Source

**Step 2**

To add a new Youtube Video Source you need to input your YouTube Channel ID. Input
your YouTube Channel ID and click save changes.

**Step 3**

Once you click save changes, the Zype Platform will import the YouTube videos in the
channel supplied. You will need to add those videos to your Zype video library from
the import video screen.

The video imports that you add will now be a part of your Zype video library.

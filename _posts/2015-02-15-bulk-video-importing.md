To bulk add video imports to your video library, check the videos that you want to add and click
the button “Add to Library.” This will automatically add new videos to your video library. If you
would like to merge videos into preexisting videos in your video library, you will need to click
the merge chain for each video.

To bulk remove video imports from your video library, check the videos that you want to remove
and click the button “Remove from Library.” Note, this does not delete the video, it only removes
the chosen video import data source from your video.

## Link Consumer to a Device

<hr>

You can use Zype to link a consumer to a device. At a high level, the Zype API
can check to see if the device has been linked to a Zype consumer, can acquire a pin for
a Zype consumer to link her device, and link the device to the Zype consumer via the acquired pin.

<hr>

### Check to see if the device has been linked to a consumer

You will first want to see if the current device id has been linked to a Zype consumer.

Consumer id will be nil and linked will be false if device has not been linked to a Zype consumer.
Note, pin expires every 30 minutes. You will need to reacquire the pin after 30 minutes.
Consumer id will be the id of the consumer and linked will be true if device has been successfully
linked to a Zype consumer.
The subscription_count indicates the number of active subscriptions for the currently linked consumer.

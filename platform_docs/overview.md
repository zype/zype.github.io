## Overview

### What is Zype all about?

The Zype Platform includes everything a premium content owner needs to deliver web, mobile, and set-top apps direct to consumers.

Video from anywhere, including YouTube and Hulu, or even raw video source files - can be imported, optimized and delivered based on viewer location, device, licensing rules or revenue models. Check it out using our [test harness](http://demo.zype.com/test_harness).

Zypeâ€™s proprietary VideoMeta technology allows import and matching of data - scripts, set lists, art, and related content without data entry headaches.  Powerful for SEO and deep, engaging branded video experiences. You can see this in action on [yugioh.com](http://www.yugioh.com).

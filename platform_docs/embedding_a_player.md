##Embedding a player on your site
One of the quickest ways to get up and running with Zype videos is to simply drop a player embed code onto your site. Once you've got some videos ready to view, take a look at the guides below.

## Embedding a player on your site
We're happy to announce that the [Zype Platform](http://admin.zype.com) now grants you the power to "grab and go" with embed codes! Each video that you add to the platform has a snippet of code located under the **Embed Code** tab. You can navigate to the tab by finding a video that you want to embed and clicking on the edit button. The tab appears along the top of the menu.

### Using the Embed Code

Using the embed code is easy -- just click the **Copy to Clipboard** button and paste the snippet where you'd like your video to go on your site.

The embed codes are designed to be dropped into a web page, wherever you need them. We hope you use this feature to get up and running with Zype videos on your site in the blink of an eye!

### Configuring the Embed Code

If you'd like more options, you can configure the embed code to meet your needs.

**Format** - Allows you to choose between iFrame or JavaScript. Either will work -- the iFrame version provides more options for customization. If you choose the JavaScript option we recommend that you include the JavaScript portion of the embed code before the closing body tag on the page

**Auto Play** - Choose whether the video starts playing automatically or not.

**Resolution** - Set the appropriate size for your video. By default the size is restricted to a 16:9 aspect ratio.

**Lock Aspect Ratio** - When switched on this will restrict the size of the video to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Switch it off to enter a custom size.

## Configuring Player Expiration for your site

One of the ways that Zype defends your video content is by expiring our video URLs after a set amount of time. We let you configure the time before expiration using the [Zype Platform.](http://admin.zype.com).

If you want to edit your **Player Expiration** value, head over to your **Player Settings** by clicking on the gear at the top of the screen and clicking on settings, then click the **Player Settings** tab.

![embed code]({{site.url}}assets/embed_code/settings_menu.png)

On the **Player Settings** tab, at the bottom of the page is a value for **Player Expiration,** the default is 300 seconds or 5 minutes. You can change this value by typing directly into the box or using the step arrows on the side. The minimum value is 0, which means that your video url's will never expire. The maximum value is 2592000 seconds or one month. Edit the value as needed and click **Save Changes.**

## Enabling Social Sharing Controls for Zype players

You can enable social sharing to allow viewers to easily share your videos on Facebook and Twitter!

Navigate to your [settings page](https://admin.zype.com/site/edit) and click on the "Player" tab.

Then, toggle "Player Sharing Enabled" on towards the button of the page.

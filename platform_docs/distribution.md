## Distributing Zype videos to the VHX Marketplace
Interested in selling individual or bundled videos on the VHX Marketplace? You've come to the right place.
If you've got a VHX account and some Zype videos, we'll make it easy to connect the two. Here's how:

### Go to the [Publishing homepage](https://admin.zype.com/publishing){:target="_blank"}

![VHX Login]({{site.url}}assets/distribution_vhx/vhx-login.png)

### Choose your VHX Site
If everything went smoothly, you'll see a list of the sites on your VHX account. Give this distribution endpoint a name you'll remember and select which site to distribute to.

You're done! You'll get a brief message about what happens next if everything went smoothly.
For VHX, that means you'll get an email from them when your video is ready to be packaged for sale.
